## The SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle - a module should have a well-defined job.
- **O**pen-Closed Principle - you should provide extension points for customisation.
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle - essentially polymorphism.
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle - you should divide off multiple task-specific interfaces.
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle - don't tie yourself to specific implementations.

Each of the five SOLID Principles maps to one or more of the Four Pillars. If you design with these principles in mind they will gently steer you in the right direction to produce better, more maintainable code.
