## The Four Pillars
These make object-oriented design possible.

- Abstraction - Implementation Hiding - you don't need to know how other classes work internally, its not of your business!
- Encapsulation - Data Hiding - you don't need to know what other classes know, if they want your help they'll ask for it!
- Inheritance - Object Taxonomy (family tree) - a Dog is a Mammal, a Lizard is a Reptile both are Animals!
- Polymorphism - Object Interchangeability - a method that takes an Animal will gladly accept a Dog or a Lizard!

We have seen these countless times but do you really stop to think about them when you're designing a system. If you are working with an OO language you may take them for granted, but you should purposefully think about them when designing a system. The problem with the Four Pillars is once you have boiled things down to just four words, you've lost an awful lot of information.
