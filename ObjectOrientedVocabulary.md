## Object-oriented Vocabulary

In addition to the pillars and principles, there are other other terms:
- Cohesion - how closely related the code is in a particular module - or grouping of code. This could be a single method, a class, a namespace or even an entire project or solution. Whatever scale you're looking at, cohesion refers to how well the elements at that level are focused on the single concept.
- Coupling - 
- Orthogonality -
